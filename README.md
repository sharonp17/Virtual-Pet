Your virtual pet is a Martian Panda. Martian pandas are simple creatures; while earth creatures are temperamental, martian pandas either
are or they aren't. You get to feed, play with, give water to and put your martian panda to rest by pressing the corresponding numbers in the action menu. But they have to be hungry, bored,  thirsty or tired in order for them to appreciate your actions. You can tell how they feel by the Current Status section posted above the menu.  Otherwise, they'll want to do something else or be left alone. There's no rhyme or reason to what they're in the mood for. But that's ok. Because they're still loveable creatures and when you get it right, that makes it all the more satisfying. Have fun!
