Your virtual pet is a Martian Panda.Martian pandas are simple creatures so while earth creatures are temperamental, Martian Pandas either
are or they aren't. You get to feed, play with, give water to and put your martian panda to rest. But they have to be hungry, bored, 
thirsty or tired in order for them to appreciate you. Otherwise, they'll want to do something else or be left alone. There's no rhyme or
reason to what they're in the mood for. But that's ok. Because they're still loveable big things and when you get it right, that makes it
all the more satisfying. Have fun with your laid back Martian Panda friend.
